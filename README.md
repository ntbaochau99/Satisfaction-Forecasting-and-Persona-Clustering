**Award: Champion of the League (1st Prize) - MindX Technology School**

•	Analyzed customer satisfaction and behavior using machine learning and clustering techniques.

•	Built and tuned classification models (KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVC, Hist Gradient Boosting) with emphasis on reducing false negatives in dissatisfaction prediction.

•	Conducted full-cycle data analysis: cleaning, feature selection, imbalance handling, and exploratory insights across demographics and shopping behavior.

•	Applied K-Means Clustering (using RFM and behavioral features) to profile dissatisfied customers and inform personalized retention strategies.

•	Delivered compelling visualizations (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Excel) and dashboards highlighting churn risk and loyalty optimization.

•	Proposed actionable recommendations to improve UX/UI, service quality, and loyalty programs — praised for strong technical execution and commercial insight.
